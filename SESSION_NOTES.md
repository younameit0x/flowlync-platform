# GitHub Copilot Session Notes

## Conversation Continuity
When returning to this project, mention:
"Continuing FlowLync development - we have a fully functional platform with Auth0, animations, and Vercel deployment"

## Quick Recovery Commands
```bash
# If development server isn't running:
npm run dev

# If you need to redeploy:
git add . && git commit -m "Updates" && git push
```

## Current Session Context
- Platform is complete and production-ready
- Subtle gradient animations on CTA buttons
- Auth0 working across all environments
- All code committed and deployed

## Last Working State
- ✅ Landing page with professional design
- ✅ Auth0 authentication flow
