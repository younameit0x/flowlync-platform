/**
 * AGENT COLLABORATION REQUEST
 * 
 * Task: Complete Smart Matching with real affiliate data for Latvia/Germany/Scandinavia
 * 
 * Recommended Agent Team:
 * - GitHub Copilot (me): Overall coordination, code structure, React components
 * - Cline: Data collection automation, API integrations 
 * - Supernova: Performance optimization, advanced features
 * - Continue: Multi-model validation of affiliate program legitimacy
 * 
 * Why multiple agents needed:
 * 1. Data collection requires systematic web scraping (Cline's strength)
 * 2. Real-time affiliate rates need performance optimization (Supernova)
 * 3. Regulatory compliance for EU markets needs multiple AI validation (Continue)
 * 4. User interface needs polishing (GitHub Copilot)

ðŸ“‹ COLLABORATION PLAN:
1. I'll create the React components and API structure
2. ðŸ”„ AUTO-INVITE CLINE: For systematic affiliate data collection
3. âš¡ AUTO-INVITE SUPERNOVA: For real-time rate optimization  
4. ðŸ§  AUTO-INVITE CONTINUE: For regulatory compliance validation

This way each agent works on their strengths while I coordinate!
